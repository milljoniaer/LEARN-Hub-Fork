# LEARN-Hub

A recommendation system prototype for Computer Science education activities that leverages automated content processing and category-based scoring algorithms to support teachers in activity selection and lesson planning.

This system was developed as part of a Master's thesis at the Technical University of Munich, Chair of Applied Education Technologies. The architecture prioritises transparency and explainability, enabling teachers to understand how recommendations are generated rather than relying on opaque black-box algorithms.

## Overview

LEARN-Hub addresses the challenge of finding appropriate educational activities for computer science courses by implementing an intelligent recommendation engine. The system processes educational activity documents, analyses their pedagogical characteristics, and generates personalised recommendations based on teacher requirements such as target age group, available resources, and learning objectives aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy.

The recommendation engine implements content-based filtering with category-based scoring, offering an explainable alternative to collaborative filtering approaches. Teachers receive detailed scoring breakdowns across age appropriateness, topic relevance, duration fit, Bloom alignment, and series cohesion, fostering agency and trust in the recommendation process.

## Architectural Overview

The system implements a three-tier containerised web application architecture following the System Design Document approach:

**Client Subsystem**: A React single-page application provides an interactive user interface for teachers and administrators. The client implements role-based access control, supports both light and dark themes, and maintains session-based authentication using sessionStorage for enhanced security on shared school computers.

**Server Subsystem**: A Spring Boot REST API server orchestrates the core application logic through specialised internal systems. The Recommendation System encapsulates the algorithmic intelligence. The User System manages identity through user, history, and favourites services. The Document System oversees content ingestion via PDF processing and LLM-assisted metadata extraction using Spring AI.

**Data Layer**: PostgreSQL serves as the primary data store, managing activities, user accounts, search history, and favourites. The database schema supports complex relationships between activities, topics, and user preferences whilst maintaining referential integrity.

**Containerisation**: Docker Compose orchestrates three containerised services on a single host, connected via an internal bridge network. The deployment includes health checks and dependency chains to ensure proper sequencing during startup.

### Design Goals

The architecture addresses several key quality attributes:

- **Transparency (QA3)**: Category-based scoring with detailed breakdowns enables teachers to understand recommendations
- **Maintainability (QA7)**: Clear, explicit code with dependency injection favours clarity over convenience
- **Performance (QA5, QA6)**: Two-stage scoring pipeline and hard filtering ensure sub-three-second response times
- **Extensibility (QA1, QA8)**: Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation enables integration with external learning platforms

## Quick Start

### Spring Boot (Current Implementation)
See [`docs/dev-setup-spring.md`](docs/dev-setup-spring.md)

**Quick start**:
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose -f compose-spring.yml up postgres -d

# Run migrations
cd server-spring && make db-migrate

# Start server
make dev
```

### Flask (Legacy - Deprecated)
See [`docs/dev-setup.md`](docs/dev-setup.md) for the legacy Flask setup.

## Services

Once running, access the system at:

- **Client**: http://localhost:3001
- **Server API**: http://localhost:5001
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:5001/api/openapi
- **Hosted API Documentation (test deployment)**: https://learnhub-test.aet.cit.tum.de/api/openapi/swagger

## Environment Configuration

The application requires environment variables for API integrations, security keys, and database configuration:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Key configuration variables:
- `LLM_API_KEY` - API key for automated content processing
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - JWT token signing
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SMTP_*` - Email service configuration for teacher verification

See `example.env` for a complete list of configurable variables.
